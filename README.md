## Purpose

- This project was developed as part of a portfolio to demonstrate:
- Static website creation with HTML/CSS/JS
- Educational content presentation
- Interactive quizzes with real-time feedback
- Cypress test automation for frontend validation

> The quiz for **Lesson 1** has been fully automated using **Cypress**.  
> The test script (`quiz.cy.js`) verifies that correct answers are marked with positive feedback and incorrect answers trigger the appropriate error messages.  
> This ensures that the quiz logic behaves as expected and provides immediate validation feedback to the user.
